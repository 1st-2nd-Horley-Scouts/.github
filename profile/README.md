![Hi (wave emoji), We are first and second Horley Scouts](profile-banner.png)
We are a small scout group based in the UK and are part of the TSA.

### This page is a home for our web projects;
All are PHP based and we hope to be able to share the codebases in the future.

- Our group website: [12hs.org.uk](https://12hs.org.uk) soon moving to [1st2ndhorleyscouts.org.uk](https://1st2ndhorleyscouts.org.uk)
- Scout Post: [12hs.org.uk/post](https://12hs.org.uk/post) (This is a simple front end site for our yearly christmas card delivery service with a vast backend for stats collection and delivery tracking.)
- ScoutsEMU: As still in progress Equipment Managment Utility/quatermaster database
