![Hi (wave emoji), We are first and second Horley Scouts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1st-2nd-Horley-Scouts/.github/main/profile/profile-banner.png)
We are a small scout group based in the UK and are part of the TSA.

### Github is a home for some of our web projects;
All are PHP based and we hope to be able to share the codebases in the future.

- **Our group website:** [12hs.org.uk](https://12hs.org.uk) soon moving to [1st2ndhorleyscouts.org.uk](https://1st2ndhorleyscouts.org.uk)
- **Scout Post:** [12hs.org.uk/post](https://12hs.org.uk/post) (This is a simple front end site for our yearly christmas card delivery service with a vast backend for stats collection and delivery tracking.)
- **ScoutsEMU:** A still in progress **E**quipment **M**anagment **U**tility/quatermaster database
